Introduction
------------

To start a postgraduate primary specialist or secondary ITE course specialising in 
computing or computer science a successful applicant will need to have demonstrated 
that they already have sufficient subject knowledge to begin the course and the capacity 
to develop such knowledge where they have identified ‘knowledge gaps’, before 
completing the course. The subject knowledge specified below is considered by an 
expert group, comprising members from the computer and games industry, computer 
science academics, Naace, ITTE and CAS, to be the minimum necessary for trainees to 
take full advantage of the training offered and to produce teachers capable of teaching a 
rigorous course and in the secondary phase leading to a high status qualification in 
computing.

For a primary specialist entering a post-graduate course this subject knowledge may be 
demonstrated by the applicant having an ‘A’ level in Computing/Computer Science or the 
equivalent - possibly gained through industrial or school-based experience or a subject 
knowledge enhancement course (SKE) in computing / computer science. Trainees 
completing an undergraduate course as a primary computing specialist will need to have 
covered these criteria by the completion of their course. For a secondary specialist this 
subject knowledge may be demonstrated by the applicant having a degree with a 
significant content in computing / computer science or the equivalent - possibly gained 
through industrial or school-based experience or a SKE course in computing/computer 
science.

These criteria are indicative only and providers are free to develop their own. The criteria1
below should support institutions in developing the syllabus for a SKE course.

below, at the level appropriate for entry to the relevant teacher training course:
1. Language, Machines & Computation - languages, algorithms, machines and

3. Communication & Co-ordination - input-process-output, communication 
protocols, networks and the internet
4. Abstraction and Design – hardware, software, simulation & modelling, 
interfaces, categorisation
5. Wider Context of Computing - intelligence & consciousness, looking at the 
natural world in computational terms, creativity & intellectual property, moral & 
ethical considerations, uses of computing and jobs/career paths

Key processes
-------------
Demonstrate understanding of and apply the key processes associated with 
Computational Thinking, at the level appropriate for entry to the relevant teacher training 
course:
1. Abstraction – modelling (representing real world issues, systems, situations); 
decomposing (breaking a problem into sub problems, solving sub problems, 
putting solutions together); generalising & classifying.
2. Programming - design and write programs; abstraction mechanisms; 
debugging, testing and reasoning about programs
