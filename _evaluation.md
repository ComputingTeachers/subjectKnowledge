The Subject Knowledge Audit has been reworked and reformatted to help enhance trainee teachers subject knowledge development.

To ascertain the effectiveness of these subject knowledge audit changes a series of questionnaires and interview questions have been constructed.

The data collected from these questionnaires, interviews and focus groups will be anonymised when reported.

You can opt out of these questionnaires, interviews and focus groups. They are optional.

* Student Questionnaire 1: Given at start of course
* Student Questionnaire 2 + Student Focus Group: Given after 3 months
* Mentor Interview: Asked at mentor meeting during the term (3 month window)

The questions for each of these are given in advance and are detailed in the document below.

I consent to my data being collected and used for this study.
