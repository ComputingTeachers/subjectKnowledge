Action Research Investigation
-----------------------------

* Computing teacher subject knowledge gap analysis audit rework
* Masters level action research investigation

### Summary

* Goal
    * Guide subject knowledge based practical skills
    * Tighten 'working level' (no room for misinterpretation)
* Outcome
    * Confused students
        * Subject knowledge too low to understand how to implement (AI teachable machine, etc)
        * Misunderstood "audit/knowledge for teachers" (not students)
    * Alienated mentors
        * Not aligned with their schools curriculum or skill-set
            * (a deeper problem?)
    * Trainees have no time for anything other then surviving in school
        * Just wanted a tick list for the year
            * I've done 'iteration' - tick (I liken this to 'ive used addition' or 'Ive used sentences')
* Action
    * Replace Subject Knowledge audit 100% with GCSE spec (mentors and trainees don't want anything more)
    * Test subject knowledge gaps with passed GCSE papers
    * Offer trainees the opportunity to take GCSE in May (Barton Court collaboration)
    * Focus on quality of lessons delivered rather than abstract audits
