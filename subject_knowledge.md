Secondary Computing - Subject Knowledge
=======================================

* This is a tool to help you track and develop your subject knowledge
* Perform a _gap analysis_ of your own skills
* It is not expected that even professional teachers are at level 4 in all categories
* This audit is NOT used for assessment. It is a tool to help teachers grow
* Levels 1-2 covers a subset of required Computing teachers skills focusing on 'Technical' and 'Content' knowledge from the TPACK model
    * [Technological pedagogical content knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_pedagogical_content_knowledge)
* Level 3-4 focus on pedagogical content knowledge
* By virtue of a 'working implementation' being required for Level 2, you will be better positioned to create practical/active lessons


Simplified Level Descriptors
----------------------------
* Level -1
    * Not aware of topic
* Level 0
    * No evidence available. Could reason about the topic verbally.
* Level 1: Evidence of Theory
    * e.g. past exam paper question, personal notes , evidence of training course (NCCE?)
* Level 2: Evidence of Code/Implementation/Practical
    * e.g github link, screenshot, video-screen-capture
* Level 3: Evidence of Teaching
    * e.g. link to resources
* Level 4: Masters level pedagogical discussion about teaching this topic


Work In Progress (WIP)
----------------------

This subject knowledge audit is experimental and part of an ongoing improvement program. Some topics have been tagged with `WIP`. It is currently unclear how some of these topics could be evidenced.
