### Existing Computing Audits

#### Expert Group: Computer Science Teacher Training (2012)

In 2012 the Department for Education released a document titled “Subject Knowledge Requirements for Entry into Computer Science Teacher Training. Expert Group’s Recommendations”.
> subject knowledge specified below is considered by an expert group ... to be the minimum necessary for trainees to take full advantage of the training offered and to produce teachers capable of teaching a rigorous course in the secondary phase

The content of this document is excellent. It covers many of the core aspects of computing including fetch-execute-cycle, data encoding, network protocols and error correction. Many of these straddle the boundary between GCSE and A-Level. 

If I was to actually use these criteria as "the minimum necessary" then my course would not run because I would have to reject most candidates at interview due to weak subject knowledge.

All the requirements state a trainee should "Explain"; there is no requirement for trainees to "Demonstrate" any of these skills.

#### Leeds Trinity University

* Categorised into 3 broad categories: Knowledge, Skills, and Learning Outcomes
* Items are hard to qualify:
    * "think creatively, innovatively, analytically, logically and critically"
    * use abstraction effectively
    * take a systematic approach to problem solving including the use of decomposition and abstraction, and make use of conventions including pseudo code and flowcharts
* Items are ranked with: (these are not well defined)
    1. I have some knowledge of this
    2. I have secure knowledge of this
    3. I can teach this
    4. I can teach this in several different ways

#### Sommerset Learning Platform

Somerset has a county learning platform that has Computing subject knowledge documents from 2015. The teacher knowledge requirements are a copy of the 'expert group recommendations from 2012' with little additional information about how these can be evidenced, achieved or tracked.

#### Survey other subjects audits

These are samples of subject knowledge audits for trainees teachers from Canterbury Christ Church University 2021/2022.

##### Maths

See Appendix XXX

Maths is a very established subject that challenges students problem solving abilities. This has parallels with the algorithmic problem solving in computing.

This is largely the gcse exam-board specification.

##### Music

See Appendix XXX

I selected Music as this subject has a range of demonstrable practical skills rather than desecrate knowledge. I wanted to compare how these practical skills are measured trainees.

Music Tech skills are listed separately. The categories are very broad (e.g Keyboard skills) with a rating 1 to 4. The rating descriptors are significantly lengthy as defined for the institution. Theses are the same descriptors I distilled my computing levels from.
