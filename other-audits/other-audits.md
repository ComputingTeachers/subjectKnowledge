### Existing Computing Audits

#### Leeds Trinity University

* Categorised into 3 broad categories: Knowledge, Skills, and Learning Outcomes
* Items are hard to qualify:
    * "think creatively, innovatively, analytically, logically and critically"
    * use abstraction effectively
    * take a systematic approach to problem solving including the use of decomposition and abstraction, and make use of conventions including pseudo code and flowcharts
* Items are ranked with: (these are not well defined)
    1. I have some knowledge of this
    2. I have secure knowledge of this
    3. I can teach this
    4. I can teach this in several different ways

#### Sommerset Learning Platform

Somerset has a county learning platform that has Computing subject knowledge documents from 2015. The teacher knowledge requirements are a copy of the 'expert group recommendations from 2012' with little additional information about how these can be evidenced, achieved or tracked.

#### Survey other subjects audits

These are samples of subject knowledge audits for trainees teachers from Canterbury Christ Church University 2021/2022.

##### Maths

See Appendix XXX

Maths is a very established subject that challenges students problem solving abilities. This has parallels with the algorithmic problem solving in computing.

This is largely the gcse exam-board specification.

##### Music

See Appendix XXX

I selected Music as this subject has a range of demonstrable practical skills rather than desecrate knowledge. I wanted to compare how these practical skills are measured trainees.

Music Tech skills are listed separately. The categories are very broad (e.g Keyboard skills) with a rating 1 to 4. The rating descriptors are significantly lengthy as defined for the institution. Theses are the same descriptors I distilled my computing levels from.
