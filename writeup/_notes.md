?? In a conversation with Tig Williams (Teacher Educator at Southampton University and Lead for the NCCE Accelerator program) in December 2021,

"What" is your intervention

Graduate attributes - know what they do/donot know (higher educaiton oeprates)



Missing from the audit - word skills (ment to be computing)
Complete the whole audit - IT SAYS THIS AT THE TOP - student teachers do not read

They can't all buy a domain name - THIS IS NOT FOR STUDENTS!! IT'S FOR TEACHERS/YOU

Tig

Huffman AQA only - never seen an exam question on this



* Conclusions are clearly related to objectives of the assignment and the work shows some originality.
* You justify these in relation to past or future challenges in your practice. 
* explicitly considers the limitations of the evidence.



Mimir - version control - convention cloud doucments are not sufficent for code (multiple files) - changes over time

    * You discuss the outcomes from your evaluation and their implications for your practice across multiple domains (e.g., departmental, disciplinary, institutional and/or sector-wide implications).
    * Throughout the work you analyse relevant, detailed and specific examples from your practice in the light of educational research and theory. 
    * This reflection on your practice provides a clear vision and basis of evidence for improving your practice. 


* What have you learned from doing this study?
* How can the information be useful to others?

Notes
=====

Dont ask "why", but ask who, when (timefram), how (mehtod)
Succes/ not scucess

Aims /= methodology

Aims = raise points
Objective identify steps
Objectives == how to get to aim

Who made "comments" D2 descriptors

QA (know to do these things)
Module specifications
External examiners
Learning and teaching strategy

"What" is your intervention

Research focus need to be lifted up

Graduate attributes - know what they do/donot know (higher educaiton oeprates)


Wont destroy until grades

Mark scheme
* Focus of assignment
    * Critical reflection on the D2 descriptor in relation to your own practice.

    
* Evaluation of practice
    * In the work you evaluate your practice using evidence from a range of sources and perspectives (e.g. self-reflection; student feedback; student assessment performance; observation of teaching by another educator; external examination reports).

* Engagement with scholarship and research
    * The work engages with a wide range of research and scholarship, including disciplinary pedagogies or scholarly debates within educational research. 
    * The sources cited are critically analysed and evaluated in the light of your own practice and issues implicit in the literature are made explicit and integral to the argument.

"Magic Rocks"

Interview candidate "I'm a practical person. I learn things when I need to. If I need a skill, I can learn it the night before"
"In a GCSE classroom with 30 students, you need to be able to glance at code and diagnose/debug it in around 6 to 10 seconds. This is NOT the night before"

Maybe my bar is too high
Maybe most of the things a 13 year old can tackel can be learnt by an adult 24 hours beforehand

If my mentors don't engage with this. It is meaningless to assert my opinion if I alienate the profetionals I have to work with



(Denning)
* > use competency-based skill assessments to measure student progress. Be wary of the claim of universal value, for it has little empirical support

(Nijenhuis-Voogt et al.)
* Conflicting approaches
        * "Thinking" (just the concept) or "Thinking and Making" (doing it in code)
        * > Transcribing to real code is not carried out by my students. [After writing the algorithm in pseudo-code], it does not add any value … at that time, they are at the level of understanding where they should be
        * > I want my students to be able to specify a logical solution for a problem on the level of elementary building blocks so you can make a one-on-one translation to a programming language
        * > Students will make something so they really get an idea what it involves rather than remaining theoretical


* > "What we miss in secondary education is to first think about what is needed, what is the goal, how we get there, and what steps can be distinguished."
    * > "We assess the implementation too much and I think we assess conceptual knowledge insufficiently. How do you assess whether students really understand a concept?"

Developing teachers subject knowledge is a core component of Initial Teacher Training (Department for Education, “Initial Teacher Training (ITT): Core Content Framework” and “Teachers’ Standards”).



Christian and Griffiths in their book Algorithms to Live by: The Computer Science of Human Decisions 2016, attempts to describe computer science patterns that map onto human behaviour. These are often trivial observations e.g. "The use of caching" by keeping regularly used objects in more accessible locations. A deep knowledge of computing does not seem to offer a meaningful advantage or deeper insight into how people engage with everyday activities.

Woodard in his American Affairs opinion piece "Rotten STEM" cautions that STEM is no longer about Science and Maths and is all about providing tech workers for industry. We should be cautions about the requirements of industry contaminating education. Education is border than just developing monetisable skills (Woodard 2019). It may not be wise to map computing education exclusively on to industry requirements.





Nijenhuis-Voogt et al did a qualitative study of 7 computing teachers in the netherlands about their approaches. Half of these teachers were coded as Old CT and the other half New CT. Although Kent is not the same setting, this tracks with my perceptions of what I observe in the attitudes of my school computing mentors in Kent. When I raised this point with my trainees in a seminar the debate seemed fairly balanced on both sides. These indicators combined gives me reasonable confidence in suggesting that there is general split between Old CT and New CT in the profession.


Bridges 2007 warns: "At it's best, classroom action research seems to me to represent a reaffirmation of personal integrity, responsibility and authority in an environment that threatens to undermine all of these". 

This approach is a significantly simplified attempt to interpret my data. This is an area I would like to formalise/develop as I continue my journey with education research.


Pinar (2011) in the book "What Is Curriculum Theory?" defined the curriculum as "complicated conversations" with practitioners rather than the formulation of objectives evaluated by standardized tests. Pinar posits that the curriculum is largely intertwined with the perceptions of the practitioners that teach it.
