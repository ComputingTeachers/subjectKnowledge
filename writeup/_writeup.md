# Developing an effective tool to enable trainee teachers to perform an accurate gap analysis of their existing skill-set

## Abstract

Focus == pedagogical development


Explain Why this come to attention
Cite ETAS as raising question - now taking it further


??? aims/ objectives / intervention?


## Literature Review

Survey other institutions audits

Survey other subjects audits
    music? maths?

Survey of external audits

Literature?

### Conclusions from Literature Review 

lack of practical evidence in subject knowlge audits

What are the research questions ...

..? If you can't write a bubblesort algorithum with code, how can you teach it? .. it's a prerequestit. Other subjects do not seem to identify this practical requirement

## Research Methodology

### Research Design

* What data collection did you use? Why? Pros? Cons?
* critically evaluate the use of action research in education and discuss ethical considerations

### Research Plan

Cathrin Sherwood - Librarian access to journals


## Results and Conclusions

### Results Summary

### Results Discussion


### Implications and Recommendations
* What have you learned from doing this study?
* How can the information be useful to others?
* If you repeated the study, what would you do differently?

Notes
=====

Dont ask "why", but ask who, when (timefram), how (mehtod)
Succes/ not scucess

Aims /= methodology

Aims = raise points
Objective identify steps
Objectives == how to get to aim

Who made "comments" D2 descriptors

QA (know to do these things)
Module specifications
External examiners
Learning and teaching strategy

"What" is your intervention

Research focus need to be lifted up

Graduate attributes - know what they do/donot know (higher educaiton oeprates)


Wont destroy until grades
not shared on public platform


---


V1 - diverse
    ICT or Computing background
V2 - partcipation - differnt formats
V4 - wider context - world outside of

K5 - how do you know your teaching is effective


Mark scheme
* Focus of assignment
    * Critical reflection on the D2 descriptor in relation to your own practice.
    * An appropriate range of relevant issues identified and distinctive approach taken in dealing with them.
    * Conclusions are clearly related to objectives of the assignment and the work shows some originality.
* Evaluation of practice
    * In the work you evaluate your practice using evidence from a range of sources and perspectives (e.g. self-reflection; student feedback; student assessment performance; observation of teaching by another educator; external examination reports). 
    * You clearly define the aims and criteria of the evaluation, and key measures indicating success. 
    * You justify these in relation to past or future challenges in your practice. 
    * You discuss the outcomes from your evaluation and their implications for your practice across multiple domains (e.g., departmental, disciplinary, institutional and/or sector-wide implications).
* Reflection and application to your own practice
    * Throughout the work you analyse relevant, detailed and specific examples from your practice in the light of educational research and theory. 
    * This reflection on your practice provides a clear vision and basis of evidence for improving your practice. 
* Engagement with scholarship and research
    * The work engages with a wide range of research and scholarship, including disciplinary pedagogies or scholarly debates within educational research. 
    * The sources cited are critically analysed and evaluated in the light of your own practice and issues implicit in the literature are made explicit and integral to the argument.
    * The work draws on scholarship from your own and other disciplines and explicitly considers the limitations of the evidence.

Analyse the method used


The positivist paradigm is based in the assumption that a single tangible reality existsâ€”one that can be understood, identified, and measured.
