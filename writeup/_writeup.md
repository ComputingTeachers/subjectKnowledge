# Developing an effective tool to enable trainee teachers to perform an accurate gap analysis of their existing skill-set

Abstract
--------

As a Teacher Educator, I want to improve trainee teachers pedagogical development.

Explain Why this come to attention


Overview

Cite ETAS as raising question - now taking it further

### Action Research Question
Can trainee teachers accurately self-evaluate their subject knowledge and use this to guide their subject knowledge development?

* An appropriate range of relevant issues identified and distinctive approach taken in dealing with them.

??? aims/ objectives / intervention?

### Context for the research
* Trainee Computing teachers need to accurately perform a gap analysis of their skill-set to self-guide their subject knowledge development over the duration of their one-year PGCE course. The purpose of the PGCE is to help trainees engage in continuous critical reflection.
* Mentors and trainees have expressed that; The existing subject knowledge audit is ineffective as it allow for personal interpretation of ability and typically measure the 'confidence' of the trainee.
* Intervention: Revise the computing subject knowledge audit
    * Remove the 'personal interpretation' from judgement of level of skill
* Identify how the trainee’s confidence is impacted by this new tool.
    * Will overly confident trainees be surprised or demoralised by the limits of their subject knowledge?

### Aims and objectives
* Aims (statement of intent)
    * Trainees should be able to autonomously perform a subject knowledge gap analysis
    * Trainees should target and evidence subject knowledge development over a 3-month period
* Objectives (actions and measurable outcomes)
    * Simplify and remove ambiguity in the criteria for identifying subject knowledge proficiency level
    * Clarify the evidence required to track/justify subject knowledge
    * Trainees should be able to self direct their subject knowledge development
    * Allow measurement/quantification of progress
    * Survey trainee teachers and school mentors about their perceptions of the new structure for subject knowledge tracking to ascertain effectiveness of the intervention

### Research focus
1. Rework the subject knowledge audit tooling
    * Ensure that levels of subject knowledge are unambiguous and evidencable.
    * Trainee teachers and school mentors to accurately identify their current working level.
    * Provide a quantitative measure of subject knowledge progress over a 3-month period.
2. Trainees and mentors’ responses will be captured to identify the effectiveness of this rework
    * Survey trainee’s perceived confidence of their subject knowledge development.

### Criteria for evaluation

and key measures indicating success.


Literature Review
-----------------

### Existing Literature

#### Teacher audit

#### Definition of Computing Subject knowledge and skills


### Existing audits

#### Survey other institutions audits

#### Survey other subjects audits
    music? maths?

#### Survey of external audits


### Literature Review Conclusions

lack of practical evidence in subject knowlge audits

What are the research questions ...

..? If you can't write a bubblesort algorithum with code, how can you teach it? .. it's a prerequestit. Other subjects do not seem to identify this practical requirement


Research Methodology
--------------------

    * You clearly define the aims and criteria of the evaluation, and key measures indicating success.

### Research Design

* What data collection did you use? Why? Pros? Cons?
* critically evaluate the use of action research in education and discuss ethical considerations

### Research Plan


Cathrin Sherwood - Librarian access to journals

"What" is your intervention

Graduate attributes - know what they do/donot know (higher educaiton oeprates)

## Results and Conclusions

* Conclusions are clearly related to objectives of the assignment and the work shows some originality.
* You justify these in relation to past or future challenges in your practice. 
* explicitly considers the limitations of the evidence.

### Results Summary

Missing from the audit - word skills (ment to be computing)
Complete the whole audit - IT SAYS THIS AT THE TOP - student teachers do not read

### Results Discussion

* Student teachers repeatedly misunderstood that this was a teacher knowlege/skill audit and mistakenly assumed the students needed to perform these tasks.
* Cited many times "not on the computing curriculum". Just look at the bullet points - but fail to digest/understand the opening paragraph
    * "equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world"
    * > how digital systems work and how to put this knowledge to use through programming
    * > at a level suitable for the future workplace and as active participants in a digital world
    * > can analyse problems in computational terms, and have repeated practical experience of writing computer programs in order to solve such problems
* (Peyton Jones) cited in his address - Where is the AI - we dont need to rewrite the mational curriculum

Confused by "having" to do all of the audit with students. Use of GitHub - school refused.
Trainees are unable to destinguish between role requirements and knowlege requirements, curriculum

It is a mistake to proclaim/prescribe indicative content for KS3. Curriculum deliberately written to facilitate teacher freedom. Trainees are unable to destingusg between the nataion curriculm and their first placement school's curriculum (despite efforts to highlight this in subject sessions).

What is the minimum requirement to "pass" what's on the assessment criteria. Schools make a vague attempt to define this at ks3. Mainly simplify ks4 and judge aptitude for ks4. 

Did not undertsnad level 4 - masters level discussion


Mimir - version control - convention cloud doucments are not sufficent for code (multiple files) - changes over time

* Trainee teachers and school mentors to accurately identify their current working level.
    * Mentors refused
    * Trainees agreeded reduced ambiguity - but unrelated to what they were teaching

* Provide a quantitative measure of subject knowledge progress over a 3-month period.
    * Limited

* Survey trainee’s perceived confidence of their subject knowledge development.
    * Yes
    * more ...


They don't have the time to upskill - NCCE certificates and money - importance of recruitment

Although student teachers identified that the items on the new subject knowledge audit did not fit what they were teaching in school. As each school creates it;s own material, I would suspect that it would be difficult for a number of computing teachers to refine a master list. This is why there is no agreed upon master list.

### Implications and Recommendations

    * You discuss the outcomes from your evaluation and their implications for your practice across multiple domains (e.g., departmental, disciplinary, institutional and/or sector-wide implications).
    * Throughout the work you analyse relevant, detailed and specific examples from your practice in the light of educational research and theory. 
    * This reflection on your practice provides a clear vision and basis of evidence for improving your practice. 

The old subject knowledge audit provided little meaningful value because

The new subject knowledge audit provided little meaningful value because


My original concept, was that if teachers were able to practically demonstraight the theoretical computing concepts with practical application. This would improve the quality of lessons computing teachers were able to create. The average trainee does not have the practical skills to do this and there is not sufficient time within the course to develop these skills.

In modifying to the subject knowledge audit to include a practical dimension I alienated mentors and demoralised trainees.

I wanted to show a 'complete world map' of the dimensions of the disaplin of computing. Even with verbal guidance and supporting text, many of my trainees were unable to distinguish what 'could be possible over a lifetime of teaching computing' with 'what is required in the next few months to gain qualified teacher status'. They were unable to conceive the audit tool as something they might be referring to for the next 5 years+.

* What have you learned from doing this study?
* How can the information be useful to others?

#### Next study

* If you repeated the study, what would you do differently?


#### Actions to improve practice

There is no need for a separate specialised teacher subject knowledge audit.
An exam board GCSE specification lists the knowledge/skills needed and has mechanisms for assessment/measurement.
Teachers do not have the capacity to teach topics that students are not directly assessed on.
Trainees teachers do not have the capacity to focus on developing sills for topics that students are not directly assessed on.

My subject knowledge audit enhancements focused around developing practical computing skills. The reality is that students (and therefore teachers) don't need these practical skills. The requirement for teachers is that students have the knowledge to pass the GCSE exam. Any knowledge/skills beyond a GCSE would not be standardised across a county or the country. Is up to the individual teachers or individual school computing departments to develop their own custom opportunities should they have the capacity. These additional opportunities cannot (and maybe 'should not') be controlled by external entities.

Actions for 2022/2023 academic year:
* Replace the trainee teacher subject knowledge audit with an amalgamation of current GCSE specifications from active exam boards
* Ask student teachers to judge their level of skill by self administering and marking their own attempt at GCSE past papers
* Remove any reference to A-Level topics - these are beyond the scope of the course
* Direct trainee teachers towards existing skills certifications such as 'the NCCE Computer Science Accelerator' program that acrews bursaries for trainee teachers to take to their first employing school

Industry is taking measures into their own hands. Many employers are loosing faith in the weight behind formal qualifications. Industry is inventing their own professional certification and their own recruitment screening process that is largely based on practical skills. (citation needed)

The follow-up question we should return to is "What is the purpose of Computing Education in secondary schools, what should we be focusing on? and how can we make meaningful positive change?"

"Magic Rocks"

Interview candidate "I'm a practical person. I learn things when I need to. If I need a skill, I can learn it the night before"
"In a GCSE classroom with 30 students, you need to be able to glance at code and diagnose/debug it in around 6 to 10 seconds. This is NOT the night before"

Maybe my bar is too high
Maybe most of the things a 13 year old can tackel can be learnt by an adult 24 hours beforehand

If my mentors don't engage with this. It is meaningless to assert my opinion if I alienate the profetionals I have to work with

* > use competency-based skill assessments to measure student progress. Be wary of the claim of universal value, for it has little empirical support

(Nijenhuis-Voogt et al.)
* Conflicting approaches
        * "Thinking" (just the concept) or "Thinking and Making" (doing it in code)
        * > Transcribing to real code is not carried out by my students. [After writing the algorithm in pseudo-code], it does not add any value … at that time, they are at the level of understanding where they should be
        * > I want my students to be able to specify a logical solution for a problem on the level of elementary building blocks so you can make a one-on-one translation to a programming language
        * > Students will make something so they really get an idea what it involves rather than remaining theoretical


* > "What we miss in secondary education is to first think about what is needed, what is the goal, how we get there, and what steps can be distinguished."
    * > "We assess the implementation too much and I think we assess conceptual knowledge insufficiently. How do you assess whether students really understand a concept?"
