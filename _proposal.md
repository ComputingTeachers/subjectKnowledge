## Action Research Question
Can trainee teachers accurately self-evaluate their subject knowledge and use this to guide their subject knowledge development?

## Title of research project
Developing an effective tool to enable trainee teachers to perform an accurate gap analysis of their existing skill-set

## Aims and objectives
* Aims
    * Trainees should be able to autonomously perform a subject knowledge gap analysis
    * Trainees should target and evidence subject knowledge development over a 3-month period
* Objectives
    * Simplify and remove ambiguity in the criteria for identifying subject knowledge proficiency level
    * Consider the evidence required for areas of subject knowledge
    * Measure effectiveness of the intervention by surveying trainee teachers and school mentors about their perceptions of the new structure for subject knowledge tracking

## Context for the research
Trainee Computing teachers need to accurately perform a gap analysis of their skill-set to self-guide their subject knowledge development over the duration of their one-year PGCE course. The purpose of the PGCE is to help trainees engage in continuous critical reflection.

Mentors and trainees have expressed that; Existing subject knowledge audits are ineffective as they allow for personal interpretation of ability and typically measure the confidence of the trainee.

This revised subject knowledge audit might allow direct comparisons between teacher’s knowledge sets. This could be important with developing future course strategies to enhance subject knowledge development.

A secondary opportunity for study will be to identify how the trainee’s confidence is impacted by this new tool. Will overly confident trainees be surprised or demoralised by how limited their knowledge may be?


## Research focus
1. Rework the subject knowledge audit tooling
    * to include clearly evidencable practical components 
    * trainee teachers and school mentors to accurately identify their current working level
    * provide a quantitative measure of subject knowledge progress over a 3-month period. 
2. Trainees and mentors’ responses will be captured to identify the effectiveness of this rework 
    * Survey trainee’s perceived confidence of their subject knowledge development.

## Research method(s)
* Trainees
    * Questionnaire at start of course
    * Questionnaire after 3 months
    * Focus group discussion
* Mentors
    * Interview questions

## Research timetable
22nd September 2021 to 17th December 2021
