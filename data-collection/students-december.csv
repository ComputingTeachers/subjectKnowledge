ID,Start time,Completion time,To correlate your answers from this questionnaire with the previous questionnaire 3 months ago; What is your unique fake name or id?,Now you have used the new subject audit model. How do you feel about the previous and new models?,"Has your preference changed since the last questionnaire? I it has, why has it changed?",How do you currently feel about your current skill-set as described by the subject knowledge audit gap analysis?,If your confidence level has changed; Why has your confidence level changed?,What items from the new subject knowledge audit have your completed since the questionnaire 3 months ago?,Is their a difference from what you predicted you would complete? Why does this difference exist?,Do you have any additional commentary?

",Maybe more on programming but I have not taught this much so it has to move  in the areas that i have been asked to teach.,"There area  lot of areas that are qute specific Q1 and may not be taught at all schools or maybe only at a level S2.
Maybe could have more lower levels things S1 in regards to digital literacy. S6"
2,12/10/21 11:34:39,12/10/21 11:49:12,Trainee?,I somewhat prefer the new audit model,It has not changed my preference but I still prefer the new audit model for its clarity Q1 and easy to answer the confidence for each topic. ,I have no response,"The examples of topic from the new subject knowledge audit does not meet some of the topics I have made lesson S1. For example, E-safety, Data representation (How text is stored and sound), and Basic construct in programming (Sequence, Selection and Iteration)",Unfortunately there were no items matched Q4 .  ,No. ,"The new subject knowledge audit has a clearness when it comes to choosing what level we are confident for each topic given Q1. However, not all topics were mentioned in KS3 as I feel most of the topic in the audit are KS4 and A-level. S2 "
3,12/10/21 11:34:27,12/10/21 11:49:28,Trainee2,I somewhat prefer the previous audit model,"After discussion with several other teachers in my placement as well as, professional mentor and subject mentor who both teach computing, I've been told not to use the new audit, as they don't feel that it relates to the curriculum taught C3 in Sandwich tech. 

The previous audit is very basic but better captures the topics taught on AQA curriculum in the school I'm working at Q3. So from a workload perspective, I think that the old audit is better M2 , as it gives me more flexibility to work on developing my skills in ways that I see fit, as opposed to a pre-prescribed way Q1. 

",I feel slightly confident about my abilities,"My confidence has increased as a result of teaching in a secondary school for three months. I am now aware that my subject knowledge is good enough to deliver classes, as opposed to pre-teaching, when I assumed that some particularly high-level students might have subject knowledge better than mine, which is far from the case in the secondary school I am currently working in. C2 ","I am more familiar with GDPR now, as I've done several training sessions on it. I'm also more familiar with SQL now, as I've taught several classes on it. ","Yes. I planned to spend more time on some other areas, such as refreshing my knowledge of Javascript, training an AI classifier. But I haven't had time for significant work on my subject knowledge which is outside areas of the curriculum B2. I'm already working 7-5 most days and many days 7-6. ","I feel like unless I was to get my assignments done before the Christmas holiday, and spend my entire Christmas holiday and other school holidays working on this subject knowledge audit, I would be unable to complete everything on the audit M2. 

This doesn't include teaching for levels 3 and 4 S1. Which due to my current environment, is impossible. As I have to stick to the curriculum as mandated by the school and many of the subjects in this audit are not in the curriculum. After negotiation, I was able to get them to install Pycharm IDE on the computers, but the command line cannot be accessed in a meaningful way B1, mail merge is not part of the computing curriculum, nor is micro-controllers, virtualisation, and many of the other tasks on the audit S2. The department management outright refused to allow me to teach according to this audit, has explicitly said no Github. M4

The audit has felt a bit out of place in terms of what is expected from a teacher. "
4,12/10/21 11:34:25,12/10/21 11:49:49,Trainee4,I somewhat prefer the previous audit model,"Yes, as I have now seen what is being taught at school, it's doesn't really match up with the SOW at the school.",I am slightly under-confident about my abilities,I am not practicing the skills reflected as those topics listed in the subject knowledge audit.,I have completed the algorithm search topics.  Touched on many others but not sufficient to increase the level.,"The school is teaching a number of things that are not in the audit.  Such as basic Word skills and other more ICT focused topics (iMedia) S3. I have taught some lessons that are not shown directly in the audit such as logic gates, though they may be inferred from other questions possibly.","Where as the other audit was too low/easy, Q2 possibly this is setting the bar too high S2, more aimed at A-Level than GCSE, and even then a number of the topics may not be covered.  I don't think the SOW would reflect these in the school I am at. Some of them would be too big a topic for the time the students have available (2 lessons a week) M3"
5,12/10/21 11:35:04,12/10/21 11:49:54,854321,I prefer the previous audit model,No.,I am slightly under-confident about my abilities,"Several of the points on the new subject-knowledge audit are well outside of the scope of Ks3, GCSEs and A Levels in Computer Science S2. In discussion with my department and Computing Teachers at other schools they have also agreed that there are several points that would not be covered in a Secondary School. I fear that the new audit goes too far in the opposite direction to the old subject audit. Whereby, the old subject audit may have made student teachers feel over confident in their subject-knowledge. Whereas, the new audit has the opposite effect of making them feel less confident in their subject-knowledge. I believe that the audit should be better aligned to the subject-knowledge required for the environment that we are in.","- Making Sorting Algorithms
- Making Search Algorithm
- Number Bases
- Careers
- Societal Impact S6
- Privacy
-Advanced web search
-Create a simple computer model",No,"I believe that the subject-knowledge audit tracker should be used to support student teachers development throughout the course and this would be best served by having stronger links to the subject-knowledge the student teacher will be applying in the classroom S2 . The risk otherwise, is that it adds an unnecessary overhead of a student teacher going to learn a specific point of this tracker which whilst may be useful knowledge will not be applied to the classroom setting. A closer alignment to the classroom also ensures that students can see the benefit first hand of their evolving subject-knowledge by being able to speak about the content being covered as well as talking around the material better.

I fully appreciate the importance of having a broad knowledge of computing and the skills above and beyond the secondary school setting. Perhaps the audit could be split up into categories such as 'Computer Science Knowledge for Schools' and 'Wider Subject Knowledge' to avoid the risk of unnecessarily knocking the confidence of student teacher's subject knowledge."
6,12/10/21 11:32:57,12/10/21 11:50:06,Trainee7,I prefer the new audit model,"My subject knowledge is now limited to the one in the syllabus followed by the school. More topics covered in school are not included in the audit. Hence, the pending topics are yet to be covered.",I feel slightly confident about my abilities,Got a chance to explore more on the curriculum,"Microbit, Cyphers, Pishing, number bases,","Yes, plenty of topics to be covered. Some of the topics are not part of my placement school syllabus, hence, current learnings are focused on the one in the syllabus. However I am trying to catch up with the topics listed in the audit. Hopefully by next audit more than 65% of the areas will be covered.",More topics to be added
