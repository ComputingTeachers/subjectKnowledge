Trainee1: Obviously looking at the subject knowledge, the new one, and I think in our placements, through doing lessons and just observing lessons, we haven't covered many of the topics in the new audit. S2 That's my feeling. I don't have the knowledge and understanding, be well versed to teach that and answer those questions. More experience is more experience.

Trainee2: Were you able to help judge your student teacher knowledge though Q1

Trainee1: yes

Trainee3: With the subject audit, it helps us track where we are, and feeling confident to want to deliver this lesson


Trainee4: THe levels were much clearer than the old one Q1. That was helpful but I don't know if i'm going to cover a lot of the things/topics in the scheme of work in the school I'm at S2. That's the downside. It's more accurate at judging but I may not get onto the other topics with the time allowed B2

Trainee5: I agree on the new subject knowledge audit. What they do at Ks3, Ks4 or A-Level and talking to my department as well, they are also of a similar mindset. I'm not saying that there are not more advanced skills that we should learn. We all do this job because we want to learn more, but I think there needs to be more in the way of subject knowledge that is relevant to secondary schools S2 and potentially breaking it into two tables of secondary computing subject knowledge and wider subject knowledge as well, so that other student teachers (particularly when you're coming into .. and your learning about teaching) you want to be able to focus on the skills and subject knowledge that you will be using every day in the classroom  and that you are going to be able to apply at level 3, level 4 and then if you have the capacity, expanding your knowledge wider so you can have those nuggets to take to a-level or drop in and link it to the wider context 

Trainee2: Yeah; something about the first question, I felt that the first 3 levels are very clear Q1, but the masters level discussion, I cant really see how we would have a masters level discussion about a wiki for example, updating a wiki M4, 4 was a little but out of place in the descriptions. I would also echo what Ko said about the audit. Some of it's good but I felt like it was more targeted at somebody that was going for a junior level developer job rather than ks3 student job S2

Trainee3: Speaking about that topic I think the new audit is more ks4 and a-levels. S2 Like some of the basics like for example what I have delivered teaching year 7's in scratch S4. Letting them take the programming constructs in their scratch work. I could not identify which topics they were in the subject audit. One thing as well is the eSafety, S6 so that's a point that I could not find in the subject audit

Trainee4: Do you think it would be helpful if it was linked to national curriculum or the exam boards. To say this is an a-level topic this is a ks2 topic. 

Trainee3: something like to categorise it?
Trainee4: Yeah; make it more relatable to what we're actually doing
Trainee2: Yeah I do. Match it up to aqa ks3, aqa ks4 and aqa ks5 that would be a better list of topics for us to show our subject knowledge and how it's expanded it in relation to teaching we've been doing

Trainee5: Yeah; a main table and the wider subject knowledge beyond that. In the main table, like you've got the column of tags you could have student level or something like that so you could see if this is something at Ks3, Ks4 or might be something at Ks5. It would work for new teachers. One document that works for multiple people. Actually; having blocked be key stage rather than exam board will help build awareness. At the end of the day we might not teach it at our school but we might teach it at our next school or some point in the future . So going into detail for each exam board could open up.

Trainee2: "Is it possible to have a higher level of pedagogical knowledge or concepts without showing evidence of implementation"
Trainee1: no idea
Trainee4: I guess it depends on the topic. If you're writing a specific program to show different features. But if it's to show the more social stuff or more general stuff then there is not necessarily an implementation to show 
Trainee2: An example would be the fetch execute cycle, how could we possibly implement that without having the resources to do that in a school environment. TO teach that to a class of ks3 students, it must be possible 
Trainee1: So an abstract, theoretical concept. So the social aspects (I was thinking social engineering) it is possible to show some sort of implementation, you could have students looking at blagging or phising or things like that that and see if they can pick out things that a fishy about a social engineering technique. You can apply it to non program focused topics as well
Trainee2: I think a lot of the algorithms like "merge sort", "caesar cypher" are much easier to explain than they are to implement so actually implementation might be higher than pedagogical in some ways, but I think it depends on the topic
Trainee5: When we talked about sound with bitrate, sample rate, you can have a very high level of pedagogical knowledge and explain it really well, but then your not necessarily (inaudable) 

Trainee4: I think it's time as well. They might understand, but then having the time to have the physical evidence
Trainee5: That's the critical thing as well. Subject Knowledge, you will have to put some effort into it depending on the level that you start at, but I think it should be something that goes quite naturally along. It should not feel like you're trying to get subject knowledge separately and then also plan your lesson. S2 It should feel like it all fits together to tick off your GCSE lesson. 

Trainee4: For that last question, "Do you have any items that should be added or removed", on the audit itself there could be box where you can add yourself additional things because we're all going to have different things that we will touch on and specialise on. Because they are quire specific some of those things on their. Some are very specific but don't fit in. S2

Trainee3: Each of us has different skills and different plans. For some in january. Depends on which topic I guess. 

Trainee2: I felt more Ks3 topics should be on there. Especially in my school, we don't have A-level so it could have more Ks3 topics like scratch M6. That would be an easy way. 

Trainee3: Call it "base coding" and that could be scratch or other.
Trainee2: Something to do with python, I don't think it mentions any coding outside of algorithms M7.

Trainee4: I think you need to be careful not to go down a particular language route. 

Trainee5: sql, javascript 
Trainee2: but we don't teach javascript at my school though. M7


Trainee2: I felt like there is a lot of stuff on their like "microcontroller", "geometric shapes", "recursion", they are cool to do with students but again my school does not let me teach that because it's not inline with the curriculum, so I don't know if that should be on their or not M5

Trainee1: I've had to teach that when teaching python turtle with nested loops. So it depends on the curriculum and what they're teaching.

Trainee4: I don't know where is square, saw or sine wave. Sound can be used in other applications. We need to step back from those things, it's very specific. Q1

Trainee5: Something like "register a domain name". Knowing how to do that process I don't know if it would be useful in a secondary schools M3. It could be part of digital literacy. Having spoken to my contrasting placement, they actually focus on digital literacy as a lesson for year 7 and 8 and that is giving them the knowledge they need to survive to do technology in other subjects S3. Although registering a domain name is great, I don't necessarily think that the vast majority would end up doing, and if they do end up doing it, it's quite straightforward and they'll be able to work it out. If they've had those skills build with digital literacy I'm pretty sure they would have those skills.

Trainee2: I'm just looking at the descriptors now. Some of them are "define your impact" "self driving cars" it's a bit unclear what a level 2 evidence of of that looks like. I think more description could go with the descriptors. 

Trainee1: There is also something like "train an AI classifier", which is cool, but I don't that ks3 or ks4 would be able to do projects of that level to program a neural network. Might be a bit much

Trainee2: Some of the stuff like "the command line" we simply cant do in my environment. "Github". M7 M4  My mentor has told me "No". So how I am supposed to show how i've improved when the school itself has said "no". If I was someone coming into a program like this and I had to do everything on hear then that would be a bit worrying. So for that reason it's difficult to use the audit 

Trainee5: The thing about "using live coding tools" and that is very much dependent on the environment that you're in. (inaudable). .. not reflective of our subject knowledge. M7

Trainee1: Which topic was this?
Trainee5: Remote live pair coding 
Trainee3: What number is that
Trainee5: 19

Trainee1: Oh, "Code review"? I don't know.

Trainee3: And also, I'm not sure, but for the simplified level descriptors, perhaps if we don't have any evidence we could evidence a lesson we've observed and learnt something from the teacher. What level could that be. Would that match for level 0 or would it be a level 1. So perhaps observe a lesson and learn about a topic. Unit tests, so you gain something from it but you don't have evidence of teaching it but it could be counted as level 0. I don't know.

Trainee1: I think for level 1 or 2 you've got to put it into practice. Construct a unit test in java. At least that's how I would put myself 

Trainee4: You could teach it but still not be able to do it. But that would imply to get 3 you have done 2. 

Trainee2: A "3d printer". I'm not going to go out and buy a 3d printer. B1 There is not one at my school. Again, while we might have knowledge of how they work, actually be showing that in the classroom with something else. 

Trainee2: How do I feel about my personal skills. I feel their ok. Compare to the stuff on here, I do feel for the most part I'm caped at level 2 for a lot of it if I went out of my way to show that. Simply because the evidence of teaching it the school has just told me I can't do that. That's that. I don't know if that would show improvement over time.
