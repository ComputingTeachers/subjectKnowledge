ID,Start time,Completion time,To correlate your answers from this questionnaire with a follow-up questionnaire in 3 months time; What is your unique fake name or id,Having completed both the old and the new subject knowledge audit. Which do you feel has helped you perform an appropriate gap analysis of your skills,Can you describe why this is your preference?,How do you currently feel about your current skill-set as described by the subject knowledge audit gap analysis?,Did the process of undertaking the gap analysis change your confidence level?,If your confidence level changed; Why did it change your confidence level?,What items from the new subject knowledge audit do you intend to have developed and completed in 3 months time?,Do you have any additional commentary?
1,9/24/21 18:03:59,9/24/21 18:49:31,Trainee2,I have no preference,"I feel like the old model was more of a confidence boost. The new audit model is more demanding but gives a more measurable and objective Q1 room for development, which the old audit was clearly lacking Q2.",I am slightly under-confident about my abilities,Yes,"The new audit is more demanding C1. For example, it asks for knowledge of the creation and replication of webpages using javascript, html, css, as opposed to only html in the old audit. Sending UDP/TCP (new audit) packets is more demanding than knowing what they are(previous audit). The general gist is that the new audit seems to require more practical work P1 as opposed to theoretical and high-level knowledge in the old audit. ",It's difficult to give an answer without knowing my students and what they are capable of. Web development maybe?,"I'm not sure how realistic achieving all of these areas is going to be? Do schools have 3D printers, micro-controllers, or virtual machine software preinstalled B1? Are we allowed to install Linux on school machines? Or would this require outside funding or asking the schools to install new software on our parts? I do like the emphasis on practicality, but given our discussion today regarding how students often dislike even basic programming at the GCSE level, I do worry about the difficulties of showing ""students completed work to meet the learning objectives"" M3 for many of these categories. 

Remembering that the course is aimed at 11-16 year-olds and not A-level S2, as far as I'm aware, is a Caesar cipher in the curriculum S4? I do worry that learning some of these topics will require me to spend time away from lesson planning for the students with who I am working in order to fit these topics into my classes M4, which may not benefit their exam results S2. If I do end up with A-level classes, many of these topics do seem more relevant, but it'll be very difficult to tailor all of them to year 7s and 8s for example. "
2,9/27/21 12:53:23,9/27/21 16:45:52,Trainee3,I prefer the new audit model,"The new audit model shows and explains clearly the level of my skill in a particular subject in Computing. Because of this, it helped me to check which topic I need to revise and to find which topic I don't have any knowledge of. Q1 ",I have no response,Yes,Because it made me aware of what are the topic I am familiar with and be able to identify myself clearly the subject knowledge level of a particular topic.,"Compression Huffman, Circuit simulator, Micro controller, and Wiki Syntax. ","Perhaps we can calculate the total points per each column and be able to find out (in estimation) which values are in the satisfactory/confident level and etc.  
All over, the new audit helped me clearly identify Q1 the subjects that needed for me to be aware and study. "
3,10/2/21 16:03:37,10/2/21 16:07:52,Trainee6,I have no preference,They both can check your skills and allow you to think about what you need to be a teacher,I feel slightly confident about my abilities,Yes, C1 Down as it showed many area that i may not have thought of and allowed me to review what i knew by finding real examples.,"Specific algorithms required to teach.
Non programming related ones.","I said above both were find but the levels in the new version where better formatted so i new more about how to rate them, not just making it up myself."
4,10/6/21 23:06:16,10/6/21 23:25:50,Trainee4,I somewhat prefer the new audit model,It has more detail and it would be easier to target the gaps in my knowledge.,I am slightly under-confident about my abilities,Yes,Some of the skills were unknown to me S5.,"I intend to develop my search and sorting algorithms, and my binary skills.","Are all the items relevant i.e. just KS3/4 S2 , or are some just for KS5 (A-level).  Perhaps that could be indicated in the list. M5"
5,10/8/21 9:10:56,10/8/21 10:14:08,Trainee7,I prefer the previous audit model,Term wise analysis of elements of subject knowledge,I am slightly under-confident about my abilities,Yes,Covered the areas which was not yet learned,New subject and software skills,
6,10/10/21 22:09:59,10/10/21 22:17:20,Trainee1,I somewhat prefer the previous audit model,"It gave me more room to expand on my experience. I also felt that it was more thorough in gleaning what subject knowledge you had for a particular field in computer science Q3. The new one isn't bad, and it focuses more on the technical abilities of the student-teacher, which is good, but you may need to be aware of the concepts at a more macro level, and then see which bits one may need in practice (more micro-level) S6, instead of just tallying all the micro-level skills one needs to be competent as a computer science teacher. ",I am slightly under-confident about my abilities,Yes,"Well with the new subject audit model, I again had to re-examine what I knew, and there were many skills there and topics and concepts that I have little to no experience of doing, as it was so specific S5. Again this is good, in the sense that it pinpoints where one needs to improve. I'm just wondering if those areas 'will' be the ones that we need to improve on S2 or do we find which concepts we need to improve on through our own experience, observations and teaching practice",Hopefully the ones which I have identified with level 0 - 1 understanding. ,Not at the moment
