> The general gist is that the new audit seems to require more practical work

> I do like the emphasis on practicality, ... students often dislike even basic programming at the GCSE level, I do worry about the difficulties of showing ""students completed work to meet the learning objectives"" for many of these categories.

> I'm not sure how realistic achieving all of these areas is going to be? Do schools have 3D printers, micro-controllers, or virtual machine software preinstalled?

> is a Caesar cipher in the curriculum?

Yes; typically part of a KS2 school curriculum

> I do worry that learning some of these topics will require me to spend time away from lesson planning for the students with who I am working in order to fit these topics into my classes, which may not benefit their exam results.

> it'll be very difficult to tailor all of them to year 7s and 8s for example.
THEY ARE NOT MENT TO BE TAUGHT TO ALL 7 AND 8 STUDENTS!! THIS IS A TEACHER AUDIT!!

> the levels in the new version where better formatted so i new more about how to rate them, not just making it up myself.

> it pinpoints where one needs to improve. I'm just wondering if those areas 'will' be the ones that we need to improve on 

after?



You cant write a bubblesort (or any of these algorithms) without these concepts. There is no point in listing these lower level skills as they are implicitly required by many of the other tasks. The list of skills would also be significantly longer.

> FIND QUOTE There was no image representation or sound representation
If you can generate a sine wave, you know how to represent sound
If you can use RLE compression you know about image representation


> I think that the old audit is better, as it gives me more flexibility to work on developing my skills in ways that I see fit, as opposed to a pre-prescribed way. 
But there is no way of validating this

> I have taught some lessons that are not shown directly in the audit such as logic gates, though they may be inferred from other questions possibly.

> My confidence has increased as a result of teaching in a secondary school for three months. I am now aware that my subject knowledge is good enough to deliver classes, as opposed to pre-teaching, when I assumed that some particularly high-level students might have subject knowledge better than mine, which is far from the case in the secondary school I am currently working in

> The department management outright refused to allow me to teach according to this audit

> I haven't had time for significant work on my subject knowledge which is outside areas of the curriculum


> The school is teaching a number of things that are not in the audit.  Such as basic Word skills and other more ICT focused topics (iMedia)

> Where as the other audit was too low/easy, possibly this is setting the bar too high, more aimed at A-Level than GCSE

> Perhaps the audit could be split up into categories such as 'Computer Science Knowledge for Schools' and 'Wider Subject Knowledge' to avoid the risk of unnecessarily knocking the confidence of student teacher's subject knowledge."

> a lot of areas that have not changed as they have not been relevant to what I have been teaching.

They have been in school 8 weeks * 4 days = 32 days

> my confidence has gone up a little but I am not sure if the tracker reflects this

> I still prefer the new audit model for its clarity and easy to answer the confidence for each topic


> Several of the points on the new subject-knowledge audit are well outside of the scope of KS3, GCSEs and A Levels in Computer Science. In discussion with my department and Computing Teachers at other schools they have also agreed that there are several points that would not be covered in a Secondary School.

> it adds an unnecessary overhead of a student teacher going to learn a specific point of this tracker which whilst may be useful knowledge will not be applied to the classroom setting

> ... the new subject knowledge audit does not meet some of the topics I have made lesson. 
> For example, E-safety, Data representation (How text is stored and sound), 
> and Basic construct in programming (Sequence, Selection and Iteration)",
> Unfortunately there were no items matched

You cant write a bubblesort (or any of ther algorithums) without these concepts. There is no point in listing these lower level skills as they are implicitly required by many of the other tasks.

> It should feel like it all fits together to tick off your GCSE lesson. 

> perhaps if we don't have any evidence we could evidence a lesson we've observed and learnt something from the teacher.

Trainees did not want to actively push their skills, they wanted a tick list.

These 
Can write in sentences. Can spell words.
Can add numbers. Can 
This is a teacher knowlevel audit, not a student skill audit.
This confused trainee teachers.
One list to rule them all. Teachers have the same requirements as students. That does not sit well with me. Teachers should have more advanced knowledge than the students


> (old audit) gives me more flexibility to work on developing my skills in ways that I see fit, as opposed to a pre-prescribed way 

There was a lack of being able 

* Student teachers repeatedly misunderstood that this was a teacher knowledge/skill audit and mistakenly assumed the students needed to perform these tasks.
* Cited many times "not on the computing curriculum". Just look at the bullet points - but fail to digest/understand the opening paragraph
    * "equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world"
    * > how digital systems work and how to put this knowledge to use through programming
    * > at a level suitable for the future workplace and as active participants in a digital world
    * > can analyse problems in computational terms, and have repeated practical experience of writing computer programs in order to solve such problems
* (Peyton Jones) cited in his address - Where is the AI - we don't need to rewrite the national curriculum

Confused by "having" to do all of the audit with students. Use of GitHub - school refused.
Trainees are unable to distinguish between role requirements and knowledge requirements, curriculum

It is a mistake to proclaim/prescribe indicative content for KS3. Curriculum deliberately written to facilitate teacher freedom. Trainees lacked the experience to distinguish between 'the national curriculum' and 'their first placement school's curriculum.

What is the minimum requirement to "pass" what's on the assessment criteria. Schools make a vague attempt to define this at ks3. Mainly simplify ks4 and judge aptitude for ks4. 

Did not undertsnad level 4 - masters level discussion
