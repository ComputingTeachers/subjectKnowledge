Secondary Computing - Subject Knowledge
=======================================

* This is a tool to help you track and develop your subject knowledge
* Perform a _gap analysis_ of your own skills
* It is not expected that even professional teachers are at level 4 in all categories
* This audit is NOT used for assessment. It is a tool to help teachers grow

This is simplified and reworked audit that just mirrors the GCSE Computing spec. For a more expansive audit see [https://computingteachers.uk/subjectKnowledge/subject-knowledge-2021.html](https://computingteachers.uk/subjectKnowledge/subject-knowledge-2021.html)



Simplified Level Descriptors
----------------------------
(see bottom of document for full level descriptors)
* Level -1
    * Not aware of topic
* Level 0
    * No evidence available. Could reason about the topic verbally.
* Level 1: Evidence of Theory
    * e.g. past exam paper question, personal notes , evidence of training course (NCCE?)
* Level 2: Evidence of Code/Implementation/Practical
    * e.g github link, screenshot, video-screen-capture
* Level 3: Evidence of Teaching
    * e.g. link to resources
* Level 4: Masters level pedagogical discussion about teaching this topic


Evidence
--------

For each review point, state:
* Level you are currently working at (1 to 4)
* Provide a reference to evidence, e.g
    * `Week 8: 9IT2 Networks part2 10/12/2022`
    * `NCCE Python Introdcution Unit 19/11/2022`
    * (if possible a link)
    * An external examiner should be able to find these items in your ePortfolio

    * > Therefore, research on teacher professional knowledge has extended beyond self-reports and focused on performance-oriented measures like actual classroom performance (BlÃ¶meke & Delaney, 2014; Hill, Loewenberg-Ball, & Schilling, 2008).
    * > There does not seem to be a direct connection between self-reported TPACK and technology use in lesson plans, thus research needs to understand the indirect and mediated connections in order to support teachers in the task of integrating technology in a meaningful way in their lessons.
