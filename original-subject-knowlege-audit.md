=================================

Tracker and Audit.

* to help you know what subject knowledge means for your subject
* to help you identify your strengths and areas for development in subject knowledge
* to enable you to bridge the gaps in your subject knowledge before you start the course

No teacher knows everything about their subject.
There is no defined list of topics or other information that must be known by subject practitioners.
But it is important that you have the fundamental concepts, as set out in this audit, in place.

Subject knowledge in the National Curriculum Programme of Study is not in the form of specific factual content as is found in most other subjects.
It is rather more related to skills, knowledge and understanding of concepts.

You need to appreciate that you will take responsibility for learning new material and raising your level of subject knowledge or software skills, especially when working in schools on placements.
Your subject tutors, mentors and other teachers can help with resources and in other ways, but this is an aspect of the course in which you need to develop independent strategies for learning.

CS3 Data
--------
1. Represent numbers in binary form - decipher
2. binary numbers
3. Use a coding system such as ASCII to code/decode
4. Name some audio and graphic file types and give some characteristics/uses of them
5. Know that binary can be used to represent both numbers and symbols (text)
6. Understand that software controls whether a binary number is interpreted as a number or text
7. Explain some reasons why different formats are available for sound, video and graphics
8. Describe possible sources of data errors (human and machine) and how to minimise them
9. Know what the Computer Misuse act, Data Protection Act and Copyright legislation are meant to cover/prevent. Be able to explain key aspects of the legislation and describe the possible consequences to those who contravene them

CS4 Computer and social
-----------------------
1. Explain what a computer is
2. Describe a range of microprocessor based devices
3. Explain and describe the key parts of a computer - CPU, memory, hard disk, input and output devices - and their key roles in a computer system 
4. Understand the need to specify computer systems for different applications and what might happen if this is not done when acquiring computer systems
5. Understand the role of the operating system and why different ones have developed
6. Trouble shoot simple problems on computer systems - both hardware and software
7. Use a range of system utilities to prevent or to find and fix problems or to increase performance
8. Be able to install hardware (input devices, RAM) and install operating system, utilities software and generic software (for example Office-type applications)

1. Know what the internet and world wide web are and the relationship between the two
2. Create a simple web site incorporating information about the web and using text, video and graphics as well as links to key web pages
3. Know what data packets and protocols are and why they are required
4. Know what a search engine is, what data they hold and how searches can be influenced for commercial gain
5. Know what happens when a page is requested from the WWW, from the server where the page is stored to the web browser where it was requested
6. Know why information on the WWW does not always follow the same route from one location to another - explain why this is key to the web’s success
7. Know the role Tim Berners-Lee had in the development of the WWW
8. Understand the need for using advanced search methods to reduce the number of unwanted ‘hits’ - use such methods
